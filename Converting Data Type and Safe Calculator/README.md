This C Program has 2 parts: Converting data types and a safe calculator 

Part 1: Converting data types 
In this project, the code is for converting strings containing hexadecimal. Decimal, octal and binary strings to an unsigned integer.  

To convert from hex string to unsigned int, accumulate the position-wise values of each character in the string.  Convert 0xFFFF to a unsigned char, considering that F = 15 and each hex char a multiple of 16:

15 * 1 + 15 * 16 + 15 * 256 + 15 * 4096 = 65,535
This process is similar with decimal, octal and binary. To from an unsigned int 16,535 convert to hex: 1. 65,535 / 16 = 4095 and 65,535 % 16 = 15
2. 4,095 / 16 = 255 and 4095 % 16 = 15
3. 255 / 16 = 15 and 255 % 16 = 15
4. 15 / 16 = 0 and 15 % 16 = 15

Collect remainders for the hex values in reverse of these steps. 15 15 15 15 -> 0xFFFF
This is a similar process for base-10, base-8 and base-2 conversions.

Part 2: A safe calculator 
In this project, I write a safe signed integer calculator. The _add(), an add function that only uses bitwise operators, and add(), a safe add function that detects and reports overflow and underflow errors, are crucial to the other functions. The seven remaining functions either directly or indirectly depend on _add() and add(). Code these functions to in their order to maintain functional dependencies. 

1.	Negation is defined using a bitwise operator and the add() function
2.	Subtraction is defined using Negation and add() functions
3.	Multiplication is defined with successive add() function and Subtraction function calls
a.	Should perform with positive integers and keep track of which sign the product has
4.	Division is defined with successive Subtraction and add() function calls
	a.	Should perform with positive integers and keep track of which sign the result has
5.	Modulus is defined as successive calls to Subtraction to return a remainder
	a.	Should perform with positive integers
6.	Power is defined as successive calls to Multiply and Subtraction
	a.	Only use positive exponents
7.	Convert converts an input string to an integer value
	a.	Pay attention to comments â€“ This is the longest function
	b.	You may be able to modify your dec_to_uint() from Part 1
